# EDA and Prophecy Engine
This Data Science project aims to show the step by step process of model data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and scoring using a Dash-based web application

# Motivation
Doing data cleaning and analyzing its quality manually so that it can be used for EDA and model building, is a rather arduous task. Doing so while developing models on a large is quite inefficient too. So, this project aims to operationalize the steps involved to get a completely automated and streamlined process.

# Tools and languages
Python, Dash, PyCharm

# Virtual Environment Setup
-   Create virtual environment:

``` 
mkvirtualenv -p `which python3.7` eda-prophecy-app
```
-   Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple
```
